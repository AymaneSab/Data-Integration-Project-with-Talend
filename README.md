![Alt text](https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Talend-ETL-0.png)

## Overview

This project focuses on designing, developing, and implementing data integration jobs using Talend. The primary goal is to split a given CSV dataset into three formats (JSON, database, and CSV) using a previously created Data Splitter script. The following tasks will be performed as part of this project:

1. **Data Splitter Script Application:**
   Before proceeding with the integration steps, apply the previously developed Data Splitter script to divide the dataset into JSON, database, and CSV formats.

2. **Talend Environment Setup:**
   - Install and configure the Talend development environment.

3. **Data Connections Setup:**
   - Establish connections to source data and the target data warehouse.

4. **Source Data Identification:**
   - Identify various sources of data, including relational databases, CSV files, JSON files, etc.

5. **Data Structure Understanding:**
   - Understand the structure and format of each data source to define necessary transformations.

6. **Integration Architecture Design:**
   - Design the overall architecture of the data integration process using Talend.

7. **Data Flow and Transformations:**
   - Define data flows and transformations required to harmonize diverse sources.

8. **Data Quality Assurance:**
   - Apply cleaning, filtering, and formatting rules to ensure data quality.

9. **Talend Job Creation:**
   - Develop Talend jobs for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations from various sources to the data warehouse.

10. **Data Warehouse Access Management:**
    - Implement access management at the data warehouse level to ensure security.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **scripts:**
  - Contains the Data Splitter script for dividing the dataset.

- **jobs:**
  - Houses the Talend job files for ETL processes.

- **docs:**
  - Includes documentation related to data sources, transformations, and architecture.
